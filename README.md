                <p>Your grade for the semester is not based on an overall percentage or some weighted average of points. Most items in this course are not worth point values. Your grade is instead determined by a set of <strong>specifications </strong>indicating the quantity and quality of evidence you can provide of mastery of the core content of Probability and Statistics.</p>
                <p>To determine your base grade, use the following table. To earn a grade, you must complete <strong>all</strong> the requirements in the column for that grade; your base grade is the <strong>highest grade level for which all the requirements have been met or exceeded</strong>.</p>

                <p>Again, <strong><em>all</em> of the requirements in a grade column must be met or exceeded in order to earn that grade</strong>. Otherwise your grade is the <em>highest</em> grade for which <em>all</em> the requirements are met are exceeded. For example, if you earned 88% on the Online HW, you are not eligible to earn a base A, your base grade is B at best.&nbsp; A grade of F will be given if the requirements for D are not met.</p>
